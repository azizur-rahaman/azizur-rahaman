## About Me

I am a **Computer Science & Engineering student** with professional experience as a **Flutter Developer** and growing specialization as a **Frontend Engineer** using **Next.js, React, and TypeScript**.

I have built and shipped **production-grade mobile applications** with Flutter for real clients, while also developing **scalable web applications** following modern frontend engineering practices. My work emphasizes **clean architecture, predictable state management, performance optimization**, and strong collaboration with designers and backend engineers.

I learn by **shipping real features**, refactoring systems for maintainability, and contributing to open-source projects. I am currently seeking **Flutter, frontend, or hybrid mobile–web internship and junior engineer roles**.
